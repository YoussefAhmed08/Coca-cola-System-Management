Coca-Cola System Management
The site contains a login page that allows some administrators to access the information and know the percentages of each factory in terms of speed, filling percentages, and quality. By clicking on the name of the factory, additional information is displayed, such as consumption percentages. You can click on the line at the top to display the data in written form.
I'd love to hear your opinions.
Thank you :)
